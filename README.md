# WaifuVault

Should conform to [the swagger docs](https://waifuvault.moe/api-docs/) 
and look a lot like [the python API](https://github.com/waifuvault/waifuVault-python-api)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `waifu_vault` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:waifu_vault, "~> 0.0.2"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix test --trace --seed 0` to see all the test descriptions in order, as they are run.

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/waifu_vault>.
